# Heart Failure Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `heart-failure-prediction.ipynb` focusing on predicting heart failure using various machine learning techniques. The project is part of a broader study on abstractive text summarization using Transformer models in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of the heart failure dataset to understand the correlations and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Techniques applied to enhance the quality of the data for better model performance.
- **Model Building**: Utilization of machine learning algorithms to predict heart failure.
- **Evaluation**: Detailed evaluation of the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Getting Started
To run the notebook in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdoo50/Abstractive-Text-Summarization---Transformer-Model---NLP.git
   cd Abstractive-Text-Summarization---Transformer-Model---NLP
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**
   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using:
     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```
   - Install other required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Notebook**
   - Open Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Navigate to `heart-failure-prediction.ipynb` and open it.
